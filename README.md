# UCI Docs, Improved

A tremendously improved version of the [only UCI docs
I could find](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html).

These docs are built by Jekyll, and are hosted on GitHub Pages. [View the docs here](https://cryptoalgorithm.github.io/better-uci-docs/).

## What's Improved

* Fixed grammatical errors and weird formatting
* Presented in a much more eye-friendly Jekyll-built static site
* Converted original source to Markdown for easier future editing

This is a work in progress, and there might still be a few formatting
errors. Full credit goes to the [original version of the docs](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html),
and others involved in its creation.
